  <p1>Guinea Pigs are one of the most popular small animals to own as a pet, but what makes them one of the best pets? Well to start off, they:  
   <ul>
    <li>are small</li>
    <li>are playful</li>
    <li>don't bite</li>
    <li>like to spend time with people</li>
   </ul>
  Guinea pigs also require minimal space as at max, they should take up no more than one room. Compared to cats and dogs, they save a great deal of space. However there are some drawbacks of having a guinea pig instead of more traditional pets.
